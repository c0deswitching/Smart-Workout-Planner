# Smart Workout Planner

A **fully functional** full-stack web application that helps users create scientifically optimized workout plans with automatic scheduling, muscle group balance, recovery time management, and equipment considerations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many people work out for long periods without seeing optimal results due to poor workout planning, leading to overstrained muscles, imbalanced training, and wasted time.

## 💡 Solution

An intelligent workout planner that generates personalized, balanced weekly schedules based on user goals, availability, and equipment access using **real algorithms** and **AI-powered recommendations**.

## 🚀 Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Backend**: C++ compiler with C++17 support, CMake 3.5+
- **Frontend**: Node.js 16+, npm

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c0deswitching/Smart-Workout-Planner.git
cd Smart-Workout-Planner
```

### 2. Backend Setup (C++ + Simple HTTP Server)

```bash
cd backend

# Build the project (no external dependencies required)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Start the server
./bin/smart_workout_planner
```

The backend API will be available on `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Frontend Setup (React + shadcn/ui)

```bash
cd frontend
