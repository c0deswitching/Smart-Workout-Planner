Smart Workout Planner
A fully functional full-stack web application that helps users create scientifically optimized workout plans with automatic scheduling, muscle group balance, recovery time management, and equipment considerations.
Problem Statement
Many people work out for long periods without seeing optimal results due to poor workout planning, leading to overstrained muscles, imbalanced training, and wasted time.
Solution
An intelligent workout planner that generates personalized, balanced weekly schedules based on user goals, availability, and equipment access using real algorithms and AI-powered recommendations.

Project Structure Setup
bash# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/c0deswitching/Smart-Workout-Planner.git
cd Smart-Workout-Planner

# 2. Verify project structure
ls -la
# Should show: backend/ frontend/ README.md CLAUDE.md
Backend Development Setup
Step 1: Navigate to Backend Directory
bashcd backend
ls -la
# Should show: src/ include/ data/ CMakeLists.txt
Step 2: Create Build Directory
bash# Create and enter build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Alternative: Clean build (if rebuilding)
rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
Step 3: Configure with CMake
bash# Generate build files
cmake ..

# For Debug build (recommended for development)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

# For Release build (for production)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
Step 4: Compile the Project
bash# Build the project
make

# For faster compilation (use multiple cores)
make -j$(nproc)          # Linux
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)  # macOS
make -j8                 # Windows/Manual

# Verify build artifacts
ls -la bin/
# Should show: smart_workout_planner (or .exe on Windows)
Step 5: Run the Backend Server
bash# Start the server
./bin/smart_workout_planner

# Alternative: Run with logging
./bin/smart_workout_planner > server.log 2>&1 &

# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","message":"Smart Workout Planner API is running"}
Backend Troubleshooting
bash# Check C++ compiler version
gcc --version
# Should be 7.0+ for C++17 support

# Check CMake version
cmake --version
# Should be 3.5+

# Clean build (if compilation fails)
cd .. && rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make

# Check for missing dependencies
ldd bin/smart_workout_planner  # Linux
otool -L bin/smart_workout_planner  # macOS
Frontend Development Setup
Step 1: Navigate to Frontend Directory
bashcd frontend
ls -la
# Should show: src/ public/ package.json vite.config.ts
Step 2: Install Dependencies
bash# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Alternative: Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# For faster installation (optional)
npm ci  # Uses package-lock.json for consistent installs
Step 3: Verify shadcn/ui Setup
bash# Check if shadcn is properly configured
ls -la src/components/ui/
# Should show: button.tsx card.tsx input.tsx slider.tsx etc.

# If components are missing, reinitialize shadcn
npx shadcn@latest init
npx shadcn@latest add button card input slider select
Step 4: Development Server
bash# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Start on specific port
npm run dev -- --port 3000

# Start with network access
npm run dev -- --host

# Production build (for testing)
npm run build
npm run preview
Step 5: Verify Frontend
bash# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
# Should see the Smart Workout Planner interface

# Test API connection (in browser console)
# fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/health').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
Full Development Workflow
Option 1: Manual Start (Recommended for Development)
bash# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend/build
./bin/smart_workout_planner

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Open browser: http://localhost:5173
Option 2: Automated Start (Quick Testing)
bash# Create a start script
cat > start-dev.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting Smart Workout Planner Development Environment..."

# Start backend in background
cd backend/build
./bin/smart_workout_planner > ../server.log 2>&1 &
BACKEND_PID=$!
echo "Backend started (PID: $BACKEND_PID) - Logs: backend/server.log"

# Wait for backend to start
sleep 2
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/health > /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backend API responding on http://localhost:8080"
else
    echo "Backend failed to start"
    exit 1
